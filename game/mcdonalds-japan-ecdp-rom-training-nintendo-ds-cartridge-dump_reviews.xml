    <reviewtitle>I created an account just for this comment</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you sooooo much for this preservation of a rare DS game. I myself have never seen nor heard any story regarding this piece of history until i stumbled upon you. You are truly a big hearted person, willing to drop THIS much efforts into making this game to stay longer in the game community. In 5 years or more, we'll saw development poured into this game such as deep research and translation (Hey! If you are a rom translator reading this, please translate this gem. You're doing al of us a great favor). The future generation will know this game. Thank you so much, nick.


Btw i created an account just to say this, so be grateful you based nick XD</reviewbody>

    <reviewbody>You would need to import the save file (.sav), as that’s where all personalized data is handled. You can search for your particular emulators ways of doing so, since I was using DeSmuME I chose “Import Backup Memory” and after selecting the file chose the second option of “AUTO (from imported save data size)” as the first option wouldn’t work (since the current save data size is 4Mbit as made clear on the right of the window while the actual save file itself is 512Mbit)</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Some info</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Upon examining the save file hex data (which I'm still new to), I found some numbers near where the original password are that he mentioned in the video (482500), "160700" and "K1LC8R" if I've done this correctly. I believe these strings may be necessary for the other sections of the game, not 100% sure but I'll test it later. God bless this dump</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Interesting game indeed</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>This game was very interesting, really liked it. Gave me some experience on what it's actually like to be in McDonald's. This was good too as I was also able to understand 90% of the Japanese that was in this game. I hope one day that there will be an English translation version just like what we saw for Tomodachi Collection.</reviewbody>

    <reviewbody>In the instructions file, there are multiple rows of the letter A with different dialects. Does this translate to something? Do I need certain software to translate it? I'm guessing it's Vocaloid for the McDonalds jingle or something. </reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Create own easy pass</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Hi there,
When you download the game and use the code from Nick to get in. Go to MGR mode (manager mode) -&gt; crew entry and chose first option. it will ask you for an id , insert : 000000 (or whatever you may remember), Then enter your name (you can change to roman charachter on the left side of the keyboard) then chose your avatar and you will have a default password shown on screen (probably 160700).

Restart the game
Choose the second option
Enter 000000 (or whatever id you chose)
Now enter the default pass you got (160700).
Now enter 000000 (or whatever pass you like)

Now if you boot the game. It will be accessible by chosing first option and just insert 0's all the way :)

Congrats McDo employee ! . Remember manager mode will not be available on your own created account (duuh your an employee now) but playing the game will be so much easier and faster now !!



Thank you nick for sharing this</reviewbody>

So I have started to work on it, and when it's finished I'll make a archive for it on this page aswell..

    <reviewtitle>I am playing on my 3ds right now</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>So all you need to do is have an r4 card and import the files.
If you are in the same boat as me and don't have one of those you need to have cfw on you 3ds as well as a piece of software installed called TWLoader++. Using this software you are able to play nds roms directly on your 3ds (or dsi but the process is different). Assuming you already have this software installed on a modified 3ds (or dsi) you now have to import the rom provided into a rom folder on the sd-card of your system, start the software and open the game. Exit the game and turn off the console so that you can eject the sd-card. Go back into the sd-card and back into the rom folder , in the folder along with the rom you imported you will find a saves folder, delete the file in this folder for the McDonalds game and import the provided file.

You are now playing the game on Nintendo hardware.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Nick Thank You</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>when I first viewed this console I was seeking rare NES games when I stumbled across the rare MacDonalds DSi and eCDP cartridge and someone else asked me "what would you do if I found a rare game" and I said "try to revive it" I didn't think that anyone else would have that thought the same way so I just wanted to say thanks for reviving it for all of us Nintendo fans. P.S if you ever wanna fight in smash ultimate square up XD

    <reviewtitle>How you can load the save in DeSmuME!</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>I initially had trouble like everyone else, but I found the solution!
1. Click File-&gt;Import Backup Memory
2. Open the save file from the download
3. Under "Choose one of these sizes", select "AUTO (from imported save data size)". It's the second option in mine, the wrong option is selected by default!
4. The game will restart, and you can now access the password screen!</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>What an incredible find!</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Notes for anyone using a very old R4 card for DS. ie: The kind that only reads 2gb FAT formatted SD cards.

The file names on the VERY old R4 cards want to look like this:

- DSCDP_CRUJN6_00.nds
- DSCDP_CRUJN6_00.nds.sav

It's a subtle change, but if like me you spent a few minutes wondering, why you couldn't unlock the title, this was it for me. </reviewbody>

    <reviewbody>For those asking how to get things working on DraStic all you need to do is copy the .sav file to /storage/emulated/0/DraStic/backup and rename the .sav part to .dsv. this will get you up and running no problem. Hope that helps.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Thanks for this awesome opportunity!</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Just wanted to say thank you; I was surprised to see there was another game (well, sort of) by McDonalds. It seems this one is more difficult to come by (than the GB game Mcdonald's Monogatari (2001) which I happily own; it was quite difficult to find a copy of it!) so I am very happy to be able to play it. I followed the instructions by Pacca64 since I too had to change it to "auto" under the "import backup memory" tab to make it work. Love it very much and thanks again! (and to the commenters for helping in choosing an emulator and accessing the game). </reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>No one reads this message EVER, they just go on with their life and say they need help.</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>If your one of those people, PLEASE READ!!!

Q: How do I download?
A: Pretty easy, just go to this link and download both the .nds and .sav file: https://archive.org/download/mcdonalds-japan-ecdp-rom-training-nintendo-ds-cartridge-dump

Q: I'm stuck on the menu, help!
A: You see, if your using an emulator like DeSmuME, stop using it. Why you ask? It's because the game needs Internet in order to work. And if your pressing the third button then don't. Press the first one!

Q: Well, how do I get an emulator that supports Internet?
A:Get melonDS, link to download is here: http://melonds.kuribo64.net/downloads.php

Q: It says it needs BIOS!
A: https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulator_Files#Nintendo_DS_.2F_DSi (click on the first one and I tested these BIOS, they work. US region)

Q: WHAT DO I DO TO PLAY THE GAME!?!??!
A: Load the .sav file first, then the .nds file. Should work.

Q: Can I play this on mob-
A: NO. There's a chance you may or may not get this rom working on a DS mobile emulator and I'm not support for DS mobile emulators.

Q: I have a R4i Gold, what do I do?
A: You need to rename the .nds file extension to ".nds.sav" (or was it the .sav file? can't remember but try both)

Q: Do I download the torrent?
A: No, it's not required to but if you want you can (if you have µTorrent)

Q: Do I have to download the other files?
A: Not really, nor are they required.

    <reviewtitle>having trouble opening file on laptop</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>like others, i came from youtube. im having trouble finding the appropriate software to play this game on my laptop. i have all the files already downloaded, i can open the files, but i have the screen that says, "Select an App to open this file" i dont have an app that is able to open the file. i read down the other reviews, and i saw that someone said to follow the link in the top comment. i did that and dowloaded what seemed like an app that would work and allow me to play the game on my laptop. but that also didnt pan out. am i missing an important step? what am i doing wrong? i have a discord for easy messaging if someone has the answer i need but doesnt want to create an account to respond. my Discord is OPC | Bears #5042. any help would be appreciated. i really want to play this and find out if the training is still the same back then as it is now. due to the pandemic i lost my job when businesses were forced to shut down, as a result, i now work at mcdonalds again, just like i did when i was 16. i got trained all over again, and im genuinely curious about the training the game teaches you. for those of you that made it this far into my long rant, thank you. any help is appreciated.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Helping Jesse Jaeger</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Jesse Jaeger,
To run this game on any device you must first download an emulator for the NDS. I'm not good with Nintendo systems so idk if newer-ish consoles such as the 3ds would work with this dump. If so then I would recommend Citra 3ds Emulator.
After downloading an emulator, you then need to boot up the emulator, click "file", click "open ROM", and find your dump in your downloads manager that it brings up. You should then be able to play the training game.
Hope this helps,
Preston</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>This worked for people with password problem credit to JustDaniel #4224(discord)</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Ok so for people with drastic or whatever u have.
Basically you have to download all 13 files by clicking the all 13 button files.(when u scroll the way down to the download section it has that button) Do not download the files individually.

When u click 13 files it will downlaod as a .zip file. That zip file will then be used. You have to take out the DSCP.sav file from the .zip file called mcdonalds-japan-ecdp-rom-training-nintendo-ds-cartridge-dump.zip or smth.

Now copy the DSCP.sav file from the zip (you might need to extract ONLY the dscp.sav file if u cant copy it through the zip, but thar file should still he represent in the zip even after copying it) and  now you move it into your backup folder for drastic. That dscp.sav file will be renamed to mcdonalds-japan-ecdp-rom-training-nintendo-ds-cartridge-dump.dsv. (just copy this and rename it)

DO NOT EXTRACT THE MCDONALDS S ZIP AT ALL LEAVE IT AS ZIP

Now the game will work with the password. The zip file doesnt need to be in drastic or anything it can just sit in download or where ever it is. For me the second button worked so u can click that and enter 482500 and it will work and take u to the game.

If u need help my discord is yourmom #7077 or the original person who helped me JustDaniel #4224</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>I hate Nick Robinson with all my heart.</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>He comes in to every hobby I have, trying to trick people into forgetting that he preyed on his fans to try to start "relationships" with them. Nick Robinson needs to stop spending $3500 on undumped DS games and start giving reparations to the women in the games industry whose lives and careers he's hurt solely because of their gender and because he's too horny to separate work from sex. I despise this man baby and his soft boy veneer he uses to trap naive fans. Don't let him get away with it. Don't be complicit.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Somebody made a keygen!</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Somebody actually reverse engineered the serial key registration. It depends on your DS or DSi's MAC Address. You can also get them from emulators.
This made it possible to make a totally new manager account or use the game without the .sav file. Also, if you are using DraStic for Android, your MAC Address will always be 00-01-02-03-04-05. 

Here is the link to this persons GitHub page for it.
https://github.com/KuromeSan/eCDP-Serial-Code

He/she also developed a website version.
https://ecdp.cbps.xyz/

You can find out you MAC Address for your emulator by using a ROM that has access to the WiFi settings. I used Pokemon Black Ver. 2 to access the settings for my MAC Address.

DM me on Discord if you need help. GoodeName#6969

    <reviewtitle>WORKING METHOD TO GET THROUGH MENU</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>1. Once you get to the menu click the first button which means password in Japanese
2. Enter "482500"
3. This should work and take you to the 2nd password screen
4. Enter "482500" Again
5. This should work and take you past the menu screen into the actual game

I am running DeSmuMe which is an emulator for PC/Mac/Linux with a special save file as the original one didn't work.

You can download DeSmuMe here: http://desmume.org/download/ 

You can download the WORKING save file here: https://mega.nz/folder/I1B2AToL#ua7qseSEqs6I2JICw5-IuQ 

Courtesy to xNOLAx for the save file who converted the original save file to a working one

The save file only works with DeSmuMe and RetroArch

To get the Save file into the emulator:

1. Load the game ROM into the emulator 
2. Inside the emulator go to File&gt;Insert ROM save file
3. Click the working save file you downloaded 
4. The game should now let you access the menu's and enter the password and get into the game

Hope this helps :D

    <reviewtitle>How to play on Drastic for Android + How to enter verification</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Thanks so much Nick Robinson for allowing us to play this game and experience this ourselves! I have played for literally hours as I love cooking games! I found many people confused on how to actually play the game, especially on Android. Here is a guide:

Drastic for Android:

Assuming that you already installed Drastic, find the zip for the dump. Temporary, extract it only for the .sav file. Find the Drastic folder and find the folder named 'backups' move the sav into the folder and rename the file extension into .dsv. Now, recompress the game and name the .zip after the nds file. (That would be: DSCDP_CRUJN6_00) Now open Drastic, play the game, and now that you have the .sav (.dsv in this situation) the password included will work.

Entering Verification:

Now that you have the game and save file ready, in the first option of the McDonald's menu, enter '428500'. It will ask again but for the actual serial. The person who used it had the same answer for the name. Type '428500' again. The game should now be up and running! Enjoy being an McDonald's employee for the time you play it. (It will be in Japanese) For the verification to work, once again you must have the .sav file. Anymore questions? Email colress101@gmail.com. I'll try to respond within 24 hours.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>How can I play the game on a Mac?</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Hello! I am wanting to play this game but I cannot figure out how to actually download it. I am on a Mac and I'm also unsure if you even can play it on here but I would like to. I don't have the DS SD card game thing so I can't play it there and this is the only way for me to do so. If someone could help me I would be very thankful!</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Game Boxart Mock-Up</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>I'm not sure if anyone does this but I really enjoy having all my emulated games with custom icons featuring the boxart. Unfortunately, I've yet to see a high-quality scan of this game's boxart, so I've decided to make a mock-up using the existing renders I've found. It's not perfect, but I believe it's good enough to look good. If anyone is interested, I'll share a link for both a .png and .ico file for the mock-up below.

PNG: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d8e4YcU6Vn490uQAqmW81VH4MqWKdwAh/view?usp=sharing
Icon: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l6d0FB32vGxn-2-r5MquE3G82i6svfyg/view?usp=sharing

I really hope that Nick or Codi will upload scans of the boxart and manuals for future preservation. Thanks again for dumping the game!

    <reviewbody>Reviewer: LexugaSoftu - favoritefavoritefavoritefavoritefavorite - November 24, 2020
Subject: The third option problem
I'm opening the file in OpenEmu, It works, but when I click the first or second option, It makes a "wrong" or buzzing sound, I can only click on the third option, but I tried using the password and it doesn't work either. I've seen a lot of people here encountering this problem, so if you have a solution, please leave it in the reviews or message me on discord, I'm LexugaSoftu#1524
Besides all, I'd like to thank you for going through all the trouble for getting this to the light and letting us play the game for free. First of all, did you load the .sav file?
If no, load it rn.... it should work!</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>I make this account just to help ya'll (3rd option solution)</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>If you're running de rom on a ds/dsi/3ds or any Nintendo console all you have to do is look for your MAC address (non pun intended) by going to settings&gt;internet&gt;options&gt;system information, and there you have your MAC address.

Now, go to ecdp.cbps.xyz and type in you MAC address and any ID and password you want to put in remember it must be six digits and full numbers. Click on place offering and there you have it, a useful serial key number.


Now, open the game, click on the third option
Type your ID then your password (It should be the same, I used 000000 cause it's easy to remember)
At this part the keyboard should be free to use and now you should type your serial key number the 3 times that the game ask you to do it. And Boom, you're in a free to play a game that you don't understand 'cause you don't speak Japanese 

You can find me at discord as tinaparati#0833 and @tinaparati on Instagram.

    <reviewbody>I downloaded the dump and I tried running it through retroarch, all "stock" emulators were tried. 
I can get the game going through the save file but it won't let me put the password in because it says I need to use the 3rd option (serial log in) because it is my first use.I cant seem to get past this even when i put the serial from the video in (the back of the ds with the password in it lmao i tried that hard)
 I would LOVE to know what I need to do differently to make it work... idk If you can answer my question through here so if you don't dm me on IG @miklatting 
if possible to answer through here I would prefer it but if not IG is also ok. Thanks anyway guys :)</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Load save file on Twilight Menu lol</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Uhh if anything, if you're having trouble to load the save file and you're using Twilight Menu then mm this may help.

If your ds creates a new save file instead, let it create it, then insert the sd card into the computer and place the save file with the password in and change its name to the new one's.

That worked for me at least.</reviewbody>

If you cannot get the ROM to run, there are MANY answers in the reviews on this same page. Want to play it on PC? Here's what "Risuko" (https://archive.org/details/%40risuko) said on this same page:

    <reviewtitle>I wasn't expecting this</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Wow... This game is really fun. Musics are really great, although it's japanese and i don't understand anything it's still pretty fun. I use google translate sometimes but you know, google is not really good at translating stuff... Also did i said that music in this game is really great?

9/10 (-1 point because it is japanese but it's a lost game so there is nothing to do about it...)</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>If you don't know how to read comments and instructions, you don't deserve to play this game</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>I mean, really. Anybody not checking the comments here in order to get it working with DesMuMe don't deserve to play it. Below, there was a comment by user "codyfitzpatrick" highlighting what to do in order to play the game. However, he missed a step. The added step is step #9. With this, you should be able to play the game, barring the potential language barrier.

1. Download DSCDP_CRUJN6_00.nds and DSCDP_CRUJN6_00.sav
2. Download DeSmuMe (http://desmume.org/download/)
3. Open DeSmuMe in your files
4. Click file and open rom
5. Click DSCDP_CRUJN6_00.nds
6. Then let it go to the menu screen
7. Click file again and import backup memory
8. Click DSCDP_CRUJN6_00.sav
9. In the "Choose one of the saves sizes" section, choose "MANUAL" and, from the drop down menu "FLASH 4Mbit".
10. Then let it go to the menu screen again
11. Click the first option
12. Enter "482500" twice. (The button at the bottom is the Confirm" button)

There you have it.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Finally working</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Well you can play it on an emulator called DELTA on iPhone and iPad all you need is a third party files manager, a computer,time,patience,and to change the .sav file to a .dsv through your third party file manager add the .dsv file as a save file 
and done

The computer is to download AltStore through altserver on your computer BUT I must warn you that you need iTunes directly from Apple and an iTunes account to get AltStore on your iPhone or ipad

Enjoy all😀</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Same Shit, Different OS</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>For Linux, (any distro that can install flatpak), ChromeOS, Raspberry Pi OS, Sulin, A fuckin' mp3 nugget that can use flatpak, first download the .dsv and .sav packages in the downloads section, and then just go to https://flatpak.org/setup/ and follow the instructions. (it's best to use native when you can, so on debian-based, fedora, opensuse, arch linux, and ubuntu-based systems, skip this step (but if ya wanna do it, ya can) and just skip to the end for those specific download instructions. come back here when you're done. 

Then, in ya terminal ya ganna wanna run 
flatpak install flathub org.desmume.DeSmuME 
then just say yes, and input your password a fuckin billion times. Some versions of flatpak are visual, so just use that instead, but the terminal version will always work. to run it, click the icon (maybe you'll have to close and open it if the environment wasn't set up right) or simply run the command 
flatpak run org.desmume.DeSmuME
(if you're shit at being good at life, remember copy and paste will normally be ctrl+shift+v not ctrl+v.)
fuckin dumbass.

so then click on file, open, and then the nds one. Let the menu screen finish, then click on file again, import *something something, i'm to lasy to read past one word*, and your sav file. (someone said it didn't work for them, if it doesn't work for you, just download it at https://mega.nz/folder/I1B2AToL#ua7qseSEqs6I2JICw5-IuQ and I had to rename it as a sav file. The menu screen will load and you're in business. 

Last things: for ubuntu and its flavors, 
sudo apt-get update -y 
then
sudo apt-get install -y desmume 
OR just
sudo apt install desmume
and for debian and its flavors (including raspberry pi and chromeOS' linux), 
sudo apt-get install desmume
and for arch linux, 
sudo pacman -S desmume
You're starting to see a trend, but oh no, fedora fucks it all up. 
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-*FEDORA VERSION*.noarch.rpm -y
(the number of the version, not the name) 
and rpm fusion fedora is obviously just 
sudo dnf install desmume -y
And the disgusting abomination of random kernels thrown together that is openSUS(e), go here https://software.opensuse.org/package/desmume?search_term=desmume and find your personalized package. I will give no further instruction, because openSUSE is gross, as is everyone who uses it. 

P.S. I don't know japanese, and I got 8/10 on the challenge mcdonald's on my first try. to summarize, 
I'M BETTER THAN YOU, BITCH.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Need some help on importing save file date to real DSi hardware.</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Hey there! I managed to get this game on REAL hardware, by modding my DSi. I was wondering how to actually get the save file data onto this ROM on my modded DSI. I'm sort of new to this stuff and this "Game" seems really interesting. 

My Discord is Silas#8487

Thanks for uploading this master-piece!

    <reviewtitle>Amazing game, very easy to set up.</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>McDonald's eCDP Training Game is fantastic.
Nick Robinson put the thought into giving the game to public use by dumping the rom.
Though I am 7 months late, I LOVE this game.

I have transferred eCDP onto all of my handheld consoles.
Original NTR-001 DS, DSi, and the Nintendo 3DS.
The game works perfectly on all consoles and it is rather entertaining.

My favorite concept of the game is that you, the player, can understand the fundamentals of running a McDonald's restaurant.

If anybody help on downloading the game on your Nintendo DS, send me a Discord message. I'm willing to help!
Shemy#4283
Because of many other bots friend requesting me, join the Nintendo eCDP discord server then add me so I know that you're apart of a mutual server so I can help you out.

    <reviewtitle>such a gem of a rom! (also made a code to bypass password screen)</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>love this  cant believe it exists.  i saw the documentary when it came out.  i used to make AR codes for the MKDS  and  well im not to fond of passwords lol.  wile it works fine its just cumbersome imo so for you guy that dont want to deal with the saves at all.  here you go.

bypass password screen.
920C5E38 00000003
220C5E38 00000007
D2000000 00000000

code work with emulators and flash cards that has ar support.
when active click the first button that normally takes you to the password screen.

the code is a check sum set to when the password screen becomes active the code simply skips to the main menu.

short sweet and to the point.  ive made sure it work fine.  enjoy!</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Works with YSMenu</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Tested with DSTTi and an Ace3ds+ clone. 

You can delete the .sav and use this cheat/AR file to skip the password screen:
https://www.mediafire.com/file/61f6o3hfuuz84a4/usrcheat.dat/file
It also have every other game cheat, just copy it to __rpg then cheats folder (or ttmenu folder if you're using ace3ds+).  

You won the race because you believe in preservation, he couldn't care less. He just e-begged for the password and fed everyone a hollow excuse. Guarantee he'd be singing a different tune if he wasn't the one who owned it. 

Now if someone can do an english translation, we'll be in McHeaven. </reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Thanks! But also defending Coddy.</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Thanks for the dump, verified it works. Everyone seems to be hating on Coddy for not releasing their dump, but it was mentioned in their video that they are an employee of Nintendo France -- obviously they're not going to do that when ROM dumps are illegal.</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Thanks! Worked perfectly fine on a 3DS with CFW!!</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>It works on a 3ds with twilight!! its such a fun little game, thank you so much for sharing it!
just needed to drag and drop the .nds in roms/nds, run the game once, exit and use ftp to drag and drop the .sav in roms/nds/saves, open the game and input the passcode and boom it works perfectly. at least now i'd be somewhat prepared if ever life takes a turn and i suddenly end up a mcdonalds worker hahaha!</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>How to play on a phone!</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>You will need to have Retroarch or some other emulator installed along with a core to run the file. I'm using melonDS. In your browser, tap the 'Desktop Site' switch and go to 'Show All' on the webpage. You will need to download the .nds file and the .sav file to load into the emulator. The .nds file may take some time to download. Load the files into the emulator and play using the first option on the menu. Type 482500 and then 482500. You should now be playing the game! 

I also really enjoy playing, thanks so much for uploading this!</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Keep Google Lens handy</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>To play the game, you need to have a good understanding of Japanese or (What I used) Google Lens. I played on my 3DS XL using Twilight Menu ++ (nds-bootstrap) downloaded straight from Universal Updater (Running the latest version of Luma 3DS). Works well, no bugs. If you wanna play the game via nds-Twilight menu ++, place the nds file in a folder, then the sav file in a folder named "saves" (In the same folder where you placed the nds file). Then have fun I guess. Anyway, it's a neat game, and a great piece of DS history

    <reviewtitle>how to play on mobile:</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Install an emulator (obviously)
Enter the emulator and put the rom
Open and close the rom (I think it's optional)
Go to the emulator folder (depending on the emulator the name and location of the folder may change)
Put the .sav And that's it</reviewbody>

    <reviewtitle>Still can't get over the fact that he made this game public</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>This guy spent 3k worth of money to get it only to have it be delayed because of covid, then made a plan to get the game cartridge and the DSi to him via his brother which then was delayed again because of a delayed suitcase and releases it to the public. This dude is on another level.

Game wise, it runs as seen in the YT videos and everything. Managed to get it running on my Galaxy (New Ver) 3DS XL using TWiLight Menu++. Made a new save for some reason, but fixed that by replacing the save it made in a saves folder with the one provided.</reviewbody>

    <reviewbody>the reason you cant emulate on your iPad is because iPad sucks. its way to locked down and apple hates piracy, if you want to use a tablet to emulate a console, just get an android based device that can actually install an emulator</reviewbody>
